# Data Directory

This directory contains raw, processed, and derived datasets used in the
variant attention interpretability analysis.

## data/raw/
Immutable input data.
- `clinvar/`: ClinVar VCF files used to extract SNVs
- `genome/`: Reference genome files (hg38.fa and index)

These files are treated as read-only inputs.

## data/processed/
Intermediate and model-ready datasets generated from raw inputs.

- `clinvar_clean/`  
  Balanced and cleaned ClinVar variant tables used for analysis.

- `model_input/`  
  Variant-centered sequence windows used as model inputs
  (e.g. 101bp context sequences).

- `model_output/`  
  Serialized model outputs (attention deltas, patching results).

All files in `processed/` can be regenerated by rerunning the notebooks
in order.

## Notes
Raw data files may be large and are not intended for frequent modification.
Processed data are included to ensure reproducibility of downstream analysis.
